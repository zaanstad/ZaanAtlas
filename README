# GeoExplorer

These instructions describe how to deploy GeoExplorer assuming you have a copy of the application source code from GitHub.

## Getting a copy of the application

To get a copy of the application source code, use subversion:

    you@prompt:~$ git clone git://github.com/opengeo/GeoExplorer.git


## Dependencies

The GeoExplorer repository contains what you need to run the application as a servlet with an integrated persistence layer.

To assemble the servlet or run in development mode, you need [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).  In addition, to pull in external dependencies, you'll neeed [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed.

Before running in development mode or preparing the application for deployment, you need to pull in external dependencies.  Do this by running `ant init` in the geoexplorer directory:

    you@prompt:~$ cd geoexplorer/
    you@prompt:~/geoexplorer$ ant init


## Running in development mode

The application can be run in development or distribution mode.  In development mode, individual scripts are available to a debugger.  In distribution mode, scripts are concatenated and minified.

To run the application in development mode, run `ant debug`:

    you@prompt:~$ cd geoexplorer
    you@prompt:~/geoexplorer$ ant debug

If the build succeeds, you'll be able to browse to the application at http://localhost:8080/.

By default, the application runs on port 8080.  To change this, you can set the `app.port` property as follows (setting the port to 9080):

    you@prompt:~/geoexplorer$ ant -Dapp.port=9080 debug

In addition, if you want to make a remote GeoServer available at the `/geoserver/` path, you can set the `app.proxy.geoserver` system property as follows:

    you@prompt:~/geoexplorer$ ant -Dapp.proxy.geoserver=http://example.com/geoserver/ debug

## Updating submodule repositories

Sometimes you are going to want to track a more recent revision of a submodule. How do you do that? Well, just the same as we do with another git repository (because this is a fully fledged git repository!):

    you@prompt:books$ cd vendor/plugins/rspec/
    you@prompt:rspec$ git remote update
    Updating origin
    you@prompt:rspec$ git merge origin/master
    Already up-to-date.

 That will pull the latest version of the module from github and update your local repository. Once you’ve done that, change back into the root of your project and do a git stat:

    you@prompt:rspec$ cd ../../..
    you@prompt:books$ git stat
    # On branch master
    # Changed but not updated:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #
    #   modified:   vendor/plugins/rspec
    #
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

You’ll see that the main git module knows that the submodule is now pointing to a different commit. We can stage that, commit it and push it upstream to share the fact that we’re following a new version:

    you@prompt:books$ git commit -a -m "Follow the newest revision of RSpec."
    Created commit 9374e2d: Follow the newest revision of RSpec.
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
    you@prompt:books$ git push
    [ ... ]

## Preparing the application for deployment

Running GeoExplorer as described above is not suitable for production because JavaScript files will be loaded dynamically.  Before moving your application to a production environment, run ant with the "dist" target.  The "dist" target will result in a directory that can be dropped in a servlet container.

    you@prompt:~$ cd geoexplorer
    you@prompt:~/geoexplorer$ ant dist

Move the build/geoexplorer directory to your production environment (e.g. a  servlet container).

GeoExplorer writes to a geoexplorer.db when saving maps.  The location of this file is determined by the `GEOEXPLORER_DATA` value at runtime.  This value can be set as a servlet initialization parameter or a Java system property.

The `GEOEXPLORER_DATA` value must be a path to a directory that is writable by  the process that runs the application.  The servlet initialization parameter is given precedence over a system property if both exist.

As an example, if you want the geoexplorer.db file to be written to your `/tmp` directory, modify GeoExplorer's `web.xml` file to include the following:

    <init-param>
        <param-name>GEOEXPLORER_DATA</param-name>
        <param-value>/tmp</param-value>
    </init-param>
